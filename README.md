# Pop Culture Trivia Quiz!

This is a Pop Culture Trivia Quiz made for the General Assembly SDE Bootcamp Project 1. Made by Shen Liu.

Why? I've been a fan of pop culture since I was a kid. I got into the culture by reading comics and manga, playing old video games on my family's old PC, and watching pirated movies with my friends. So I made this to celebrate the pop culture and test your knowledge in the culture that made up the demension of entertainment and contemporary art!
